(* IR1 development ---------------------------------------------------------- *)

(* This example corresponds to ir1.  It shows how we can "flatten" nested
   expressions into a "let"-only subset of OCaml.

   See the file ir1.ml for the implementation of this intermediate language.
*)

(*
  Source language: simple arithmetic expressions with top-level immutable
  variables X1 .. X8.

  example source program:   (1 + X4) + (3 + (X1 * 5) )

  The type translation of a source variable in the pure arithmetic langauge
  is just an int64:
       [[X4]] : int64
*)


let ( +. ) = Int64.add
let ( *. ) = Int64.mul



let varX1 = 1L
let varX4 = 4L
let program : int64 =
  (1L +. varX4) +. (3L +. (varX1 *. 5L))


(* "denotation" functions encode the source-level operations as ML functions *)
let add = Int64.add
let mul = Int64.mul
let ret x = x           (* ret is there for uniformity *)

(* translation of the source expression into the let language *)
let program : int64 =
  let tmp1 = add 1L varX4 in
  let tmp2 = mul varX1 5L in
  let tmp3 = add 3L tmp2 in
  let tmp4 = add tmp1 tmp3 in
  ret tmp4


(*   Exercise  *)
let program : int64 = (3L +. varX1) +. varX4

let program : int64 =
  let tmp1 = add 3L varX1 in
  let tmp2 = add tmp1 varX4 in
  ret tmp2





(* IR2 development ---------------------------------------------------------- *)

(* This example corresponds to ir2.  It shows how we translate imperative
   features into the IR by extending our 'let' notion.

   See the file ir2.ml for the implementation of this intermediate language.
*)


(*
  Source language: simple imperative language  with top-level mutable
  variables X1 .. X8 and straight-line imperative code with assignment,
  sequencing and skip:

  Example source program:

   X1 := (1 + X4) + (3 + (X1 * 5) ) ;
   Skip ;
   X2 := X1 * X1 ;


  The type translation of a source variable is now a reference:
     [[X1]] : int64 ref

  Expressions still denote syntactic values, but commands denote unit
  computations:
     [[exp]] : opn  (syntactic value)
     [[cmd]] : unit
*)


let varX1 = ref 0L
let varX2 = ref 0L
let varX4 = ref 0L

(* "denotation" functions encode the source-level operations as ML functions *)
let load x = !x
let store o x = x := o

(* translation of the source expression into the simple imperative language *)
let program : unit =
  let tmp0 = load  varX4 in
  let tmp1 = add   1L tmp0 in
  let tmp2 = load  varX1 in
  let tmp3 = mul   tmp2 5L in
  let tmp4 = add   3L tmp3 in
  let tmp5 = add   tmp1 tmp4 in
  let _    = store tmp5 varX1 in

(* IR3 development ---------------------------------------------------------- *)

(* This example corresponds to ir3.  From the low-level view, this IR adds
   labeled blocks and jumps.  The resulting data structure is a kind of
   control-flow graph.

   From the high-level point of view, we translate control-flow
   features into stylized OCaml by introducing mutually-recursive "functions"
   that are always in tail-call position.  Such functions correspond to jumps.

   See the file ir3.ml for the implementation of this intermediate language.
*)


(*  Example source program:

    X2 := X1 + X2;
    IFNZ X2 THEN {
      X1 := X1 + 1
    } ELSE {
      X2 := X1
    } ;
    X2 := X2 * X1

*)



(*  (1) Identify the relevant parts of the control flow:

entry:
    X2 := X1 + X2;
    IFNZ X2 THEN

branch1:
      X1 := X1 + 1

    ELSE
branch2:
      X2 := X1

merge:
    X2 := X2 * X1

*)


(*  (2) Make control-flow transfers explicit:

entry:
    X2 := X1 + X2;
    IFNZ X2 THEN branch1 () ELSE branch2 ()

branch1:
      X1 := X1 + 1;
      merge ()


branch2:
      X2 := X1;
      merge ()

merge:
    X2 := X2 * X1;
    ret ()
*)



(*  (3) Translate the straight-line code as before.

    let tmp1 = load X1 in
    let tmp2 = load X2 in
    let tmp3 = add tmp1 tmp2 in
    let _ = store tmp3 X2 in

         cbr tmp5 branch2 branch1
